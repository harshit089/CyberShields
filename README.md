# Welcome to the React Website for IITG Cyber Security Module

Hello everyone! This is a React website developed for the IITG Cyber Security Module. We welcome and appreciate your contributions to this project. Below are the steps to contribute:

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project under your account, allowing you to freely make changes without affecting the original repository.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the forked repository from your GitHub repository list to your local machine using the `git clone` command.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
    ```

3. **Create a New Branch:** Once cloned, create a new branch to work on your changes. This helps in keeping the main codebase clean and allows for better organization. Use the following command to create a new branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the cloned repository on your desktop and install the project dependencies using npm.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

   You need not worry about the `.gitignore` file; it's already included in the repository. Thus, dependencies won't be pushed along with your changes.

5. **Start Development Server:** Open the development environment by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

6. **Make Changes:** Make the necessary changes to the codebase to fix bugs or add new features.

7. **Commit Changes:** Once you've made your changes, commit them to your branch with a descriptive commit message.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
    ```

8. **Push Changes:** Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

9. **Create a Pull Request:** Finally, navigate to your forked repository on GitHub, switch to the branch you've just pushed, and create a pull request. Wait for it to be reviewed and merged into the master branch.
